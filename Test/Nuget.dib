**List some NuGet package that can be used in Polygolt notebooks.**

These are just a few of the many shortcut keys available in Jupyter Notebook, but they should be enough to get you started.
Sure, here are some popular NuGet packages that can be used in Polyglot Notebooks:

1.  `Newtonsoft.Json`: A popular JSON serialization/deserialization library for .NET.
2.  `CsvHelper`: A library for reading and writing CSV files.
3.  `MathNet.Numerics`: A library for numerical computing, including linear algebra, optimization, and statistics.
4.  `EntityFramework`: A library for working with relational databases using object-oriented programming.
5.  `HttpClient`: A library for making HTTP requests.
6.  `Markdig`: A library for parsing and rendering Markdown.
7.  `AutoMapper`: A library for mapping objects between different representations.
8.  `Dapper`: A library for simple object mapping between relational databases and .NET applications.
9.  `FluentValidation`: A library for validation of objects in .NET applications.
10.  `Serilog`: A library for structured logging in .NET applications.

These are just a few examples of the many NuGet packages available for .NET developers. You can browse and search for NuGet packages using the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or the NuGet website. To use a NuGet package in Polyglot Notebooks, you can import it using the `#r` directive, as I explained in my previous answer.
